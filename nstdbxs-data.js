helptext["tempstorage"]="When you 'make a clone' or 'move box to storage', this is where the clone/box is stored."
helptext["currnbox"]="The title of the nested box you have just downloaded from or saved to the Cloud. 'Title not defined' means you are working on a new nested box that has not been saved yet."
helptext["user"]="The email address that you used to sign in. <br><br> You are logged in automatically as an anonymous user when you launch nstdBoxes for the first time. This allows you to download nested boxes from the Cloud and view them. <br><br>To be able to save nested boxes in the Cloud, you will be prompted to sign in with a valid email address when you try to save a nested box in the Cloud.  "
helptext["remsize"]="Font size in nstdBoxes is specified as a multiple of the size of the 'root element'.<br><br> The size of the 'root element' is in terms of pixels (px) and can be set for each web page/Nested Box."
helptext["directedit"]="This option only works on certain browsers (eg Chrome on Mac).<br><br> If you set this to 'Yes', you will be able to edit the text directly by clicking on it (a blue outline around the text indicates you are in direct editing mode), rather than through the pop-up window."
helptext["showicons"]="These are the more commonly used menu icons. <br><br>If you set this to yes, the icons will appear at the base of the selected box.<br><br> This is to make it easier for the user to access the menu options especially when working on a large scren."
helptext["showlevel"]="This is for advanced users.<br><br>nstdBoxes is a hierarchy of boxes. The Main Nested Box is at level 0.<br><br> All boxes added to the Main Nested Box are at level 1, etc.<br><br> All boxes at the same level are considered siblings.<br><br>Sometimes it is useful to know the level of a particular box and the number of boxes at that level.<br><br>If this is set to Yes, when you select a box, you will see something like [LX:SY] - this means Level X and Y Siblings"
helptext["defnewbox"]="These are parameters that can be set automatically for new boxes when they are created or added."
helptext["textnewbox"]="When a box is created, it is assigned a unique id which looks like MFBXXXXXX where XXXXX is a sequence of numbers starting from 0. <br><br>A default text is also created in the box eg Box ID: MFBXXXXX<br><br>Here, you can specify some text other than 'Box id:'<br><br>It is worth noting that in most cases, the default text will be overwritten.<br><br>Why the need for a box id ? It is largely for technical reasons. To the user, it gives an idea of the number of boxes created. <br><br>The other time you will need it is when you want to import it into another nested box. See 'import box' in the C menu."
helptext["newfontsize"]="For every new box, you can specify its font size in terms of REM (see 'font size' in the T menu) or as a percentage of the font size of its parent box"
helptext["websession"]="The parameters here relate to the current nested box that you are working on.<br><br> They are saved together with the nested box and restored each time you load the box from the Cloud."
helptext["refreshcloud"]="Below is a list of nested boxes in the Cloud that you can access. <br><br>During your current session, if you think there are new nested boxes not shown (eg you may have received notification from a contact who has just saved a nested box), click here to refresh the list."
helptext["accessright"]="Nested boxes owned by you are shown in bold.<br><br>Nested boxes owned by others who have given you view access are shown in italics<br><br>Nested boxes owned by others who have given you edit access are shown in normal text.<br><br>If you are the owner, a label is appended to each nested box denoting the access you have set up : <br>[av] All can view <br>[ae] All can edit <br>[dv] Only users from same email domain can view <br> [de] Only users from same email domain can edit<br> [oo] Only the owner can view and edit.<br><br> Owners will also see a bin and a padlock next to each nested box they own. <br><br> Click the basket to delete the nested box from the Cloud.<br><br>Click the lock to set a passcode for the nested box. Note that the passcode is case sensitve. To remove the passcode, set it to blank. <br><br>If you give all users view access to a box, only those who know the passcode will be able to download it. "
helptext["title"]="Every Nested Box needs a unique title. If the title you specify has been taken up by an existing Nested Box, you will be prompted to specify another title. For technical reasons, if you include a space, & or $ in the title, it will be replaced with a _"
helptext["loadbrowser"]="The browser has the ability to store data. The data is retained even when the browser is closed and the device switched off.<br><br>Whenever you open nstdBoxes in the browser, you can load the Nested Boxes saved in its storage.<br><br> Beware : The data in the browser will be wiped out if you erase 'cookies and site data' from your browser.<br><br>Click the bin to delete the Nested Box. "
helptext["info"]="This is an example of what you get when you click the i icon. Click to close this pop-up window."
helptext["image"]="In the hyperlink box, enter the URL  and in the Description box, enter a description of the link.<br>Advanced option : You can enter &lt;a href=url &gt; link description &lt;/a&gt; directly in the text. Use &lt;a href=url target='_blank' &gt; to open the link in a new tab.<br>To insert an image, enter the URL in the Image URL box, its width, height and how you want to image to fit into the box.<br>You can set the width and height to 'auto' in which case the browser will work out the biggest possible box to accommodate the image or specify specific dimension eg 100px for width, 50px for height or specify a percentage eg 50% for width means limit the width of box for the image to 50% of the maximum it could stretch to. <br>The fit options are :<br>fill - The image will resize to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit<br>contain - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension<br>cover - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit<br>none - The image is not resized<br>scale-down - the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain<br>"
